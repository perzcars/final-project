        <p>Throughout the summer of 2024, I lived in and did an internship in Seoul, South Korea. However, before my internship began, I was lucky enough to join a 10-day tour of the country. Through that tour, I was able to explore more of the country than just the capital. Click here to hear some of my experiences in South Korea!</p>

        <p>While I was staying in Seoul, South Korea during the summer of 2024, my two close friends were studying abroad at a university in Taiwan. Since I had a free weekend in mid-July, I decided it would be fun to take the much cheaper flight from Seoul to Taipei and visit them for 3 days!

        <p>Back in 2018, I took my first ever flights to the (technically?) European country of Iceland! There, I traveled with my grandparents on my first ever guided tour, taking a highway around the entire country and exploring the beautiful scenery and nature.
