        <p>Seeing Seoul from a high point was a bit of a shock to me. When you live in a big city for an extended amount of time, it is easy to forget just how big the city really is. You get so used to the smaller neighborhoods and districts you live nearby, and honestly during my time in Seoul, it was rare for me to venture to the complete other side of Seoul. However, you get reminded of just how huge Seoul really is if you go up the N Seoul Tower, a very famous landmark in the city. The N Seoul Tower is interesting for a few reasons. Although it is probably one of the most recognizable and iconic places in Seoul, it is not anywhere close to the highest point of the city. While the N Seoul Tower sits at around 774 feet, the Lotte World Tower located in Sincheon-dong stands at a whopping 1,821 feet, clocking in at the 6th tallest building in the world. Although the Lotte World Tower might (easily) beat the N Seoul Tower in terms of height, the N Seoul Tower is iconic for other reasons. One of the things I found the most interesting about the tower is how it is lit up. The N Seoul Tower projects lights at the end of each day to signify the next day's predicted air quality. The tower also puts on light shows once and a while, which unfortunately I was not able to see. </p>

        <p>One of the most exciting destinations on my guided tour throughout South Korea was Jeju Island, known as the Hawai'i of Korea! My tour group and I flew from Busan, a southern city in South Korea, to Jeju airport; this flight mainly consisted of takeoff and landing, only spending about 45 minutes in the air! Once we landed, we boarded a tour bus and set off for the opposite side of the island, which is where our hotel was located. From this drive, we were able to see just how beautiful and tropical the scenery of Jeju Island was. Later in our trip, our group was able to visit Seongsan Ilchulbong, otherwise known as Sunrise Peak. This volcano on Jeju is considered a UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site, which was such a cool place to say you have been. We were able to take a hike up to the top of the mountain, which provided some insane views. At the base of the mountain, near the sea, was an awesome demonstration done by traditional Korean female divers! Jeju Island has such a rich culture that is in many ways distinct from mainland Korea, and experiencing it was an incredible privilege.</p>
