        <p>One of the most iconic buildings in all of Taipei is Taipei 101! Taipei 101 is a skyscraper located in the Xinyi District of Taipei. Honestly, from most parts of Taipei, you can catch a glimpse of Taipei 101; if that isn't a good indication of just how tall it is, I can't tell you what is! Formerly the tallest building in the entire world, it was passed by the Burj Khalifa and now stands as the 11th tallest at 1,667 feet. When I traveled to Taiwan, I knew that I wanted to go into Taipei 101 and up to the top! One of my favorite things to do in any city I go to is to find the tallest building and go up to the top. Usually, the view you get of the city from these types of buildings cannot be topped, and that was absolutely the case with Taipei 101 as well!</p>

        <p>When my friends and I walked into Taipei 101, I was surprised to see a large shopping mall and food court. Inside of Taipei 101, there are many restaurants and shops, with offices on the higher floors. As we walked up to one of the higher floors to board the elevator to the top, we saw a collection of luxury brand stores as well. You could have spent all day (and probably quite a bit of money) perusing all of the stores in the building. The elevator to the top was shockingly fast; only about 30 seconds! Once at the top, we walked into an observation deck, with glass windows all around. In the middle of this observation deck were a variety of small gift shops, souvenir stands, and photo booths. In the very center of the observation deck, we could peer down to see the massive wind damper which is used to stabilize the building in high winds. Taipei 101 actually made a set of mascots after this wind damper, named Damper Babies! My friends and I bought keychains of these mascots. The view of Taipei from Taipei 101 was seriously stunning, and since we went early in the evening, the sun slowly set while we were at the top. It was an incredible view, and a great way to wrap up my short and sweet trip to Taiwan!</p>
